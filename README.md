# eCommerce
My backend e-Commerce on Node.JS using TypeScript.
> This project responds to a course I made in 2021, in 2022 I'm redoing it from scratch. At no point does it pretend to be taken beyond local testing, it corresponds to the backend of a eCommerce application.

**Under development, early stages** 

## Tech
For the backend the project uses different libraries

- Node.js - Development environment
- TypeScript - As main language
- Express - Framework to Node.js
- Mongoose - ODM to MongoDB
- Nodemon - Server in watch mode
